## Citations
I used the following open source code as a base for some parts of my app so as to not "re-invent the wheel". Each source I used is also cited within the code. It should be noted that I heavily customized the appearance and UI of any code I borrowed to make it my own.
1. SB UI Kit CSS file: I use this kit often for easy padding, margins and cards in Bootstrap. It also provides a nice sidebar with toggle functionality, which I used but customized.
2. Bootstrap Docs: I pulled some small HTML snippets directly from the Bootstrap docs. This includes the "Personal Details" fields under the "Account Settings" page, the functionality for modal popups, and the "list search" JS functionality used for the star searcher.
3. Login modal: I pulled the CSS for the login/register forms from an open source project on codepen, however I customized it a lot as you can see.
