## Citations
I used the following open source code as a base for some parts of starzone (so as to not "re-invent the wheel"). Each source I used is cited below and also cited within the code. It should be noted that I heavily customized the appearance and UI of any code I borrowed to make it my own.

StartBootstrap (2020) Bootstrap SB UI Kit open source stylesheet (Version 4.1.3) [Style Sheet]. https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2
- I use the SB UI Kit CSS file often for easy padding, margins and cards. It pairs with Bootstrap and extends some of the functionality. It also provides a nice sidebar with toggle functionality, which I customized and used for starzone. The CSS file can be found under css/sb-ui-kit.css.

Bootstrap (2018) Bootstrap Documentation (Version 4) [Source Code]. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/
- I pulled small HTML code snippets from the Bootstrap docs for two components: the "Star Searcher" search bar and the "Star Searcher" modal popups. Please note that I customized the JavaScript and built my own results section for the Star Seacher.

Bbootstrap Team (2020) Bootstrap 4 Basic News Feed Card [Source Code]. https://bbbootstrap.com/users/bbbootstrap62244
- On the dashboard, I used this short HTML/CSS code snippet I found online for the layout of the news card items under the "starzone news feed". I customized the design and removed some unnecesary elements.
